#  Moonlit Lagoon Hotel - Hotel Management System

## Introduction of the Web Application
  A **Hotel Management System** is a web application platform designed to simplify hotel operations and provide an enhanced experience for guests. It enables administrators and customers to efficiently manage various aspects of hotel services, such as user accounts, room allocations, bookings, payments and ratings and reviews. By incorporating CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities, the system ensures effective data handling, making it a reliable and user-friendly solution for the hospitality industry.

  The system’s features cover five main areas: **User Profiles, Bookings, Payments, Reviews & Ratings and Admin Control Panel**. Customers can create and manage user profiles, search for and book their prefered rooms as well as leave reviews for their stays, while administrators can oversee room allocations, track bookings and manage guest details in bookings. These features work together to ensure both convenience for customers and operational efficiency for our hotel staff. For instance, users can view booking histories, update personal details, or cancel reservations, while admins can adjust room allocation and monitor customer bookings.
   
  Overall, the **Hotel Management System** provides a robust and integrated approach to handling hotel operations. It simplifies complex tasks like managing payments or processing customer bookings and provide more efficient and satisfying guest experience. With its intuitive design and emphasis on data accuracy, the system enhances productivity for hotel staff while offering convenience to customers. This makes it an essential tool for modernizing hotel management processes.
